## Overview on Fintech payment Domain
A fintech payment company provides services such as Money remittances, credit cards, digital wallets, bills payments, marchant cash advances and other similar bankinhg services. basically they handle the logistics of accepting cashless payments for products and services.

Lamonade is the company
The company is registered in United Kingdom as small payment service business and also in Canada as money service business. It should be noted that it is a Canadian Start up company.

The company was founded in 2020 by Ridwan Olalere who left his company as country Head of Uber Nigeria and Rian Cochran, former Director of Finance at Opera Softwares.

The idea for the company came as a result of the limited options which Africans has when they want to send money to or from their family, dependents, children studying Overseas, or Business domiciled in Africa. Infact, the objective was born out of the need to service African immigrants globally who may have need to send or receive money to Or from their home countries or other African countries.

The initial pre-seed funding of $725,000 was done with the participation of Ycombination, Microtraction Ventures Platform, Acuity Ventures and other Individual investors. However, other investing sessions has taking place that included 7 lead investors and 16 others totalling 23 investors. In their initial IPO they were able to raise $319m. However, the company have gone through 12 rounds of funding which brings it their current capitalisation to $481.5m

## Business Activities
The company tries to breach the money remittance need of the Africans in diaspora with their dependants and relatives back home and also connect their Business in Africa through provision of a digital app which enables them to send money to whoever they want without going to the traditional bank. Basically it is an International money transfer platform to and from Africa that needs you not to go to the traditional bank to execute.

The company target customers are Immigrants of African discent. From research the gobal imigrant figure is put at 272m and Africa is about 14.5% which translates to over 39m imigrants. This at the surface can be taking to represents the size of the target market. However, looking at the multiplier effect which includes the dependents and Business associates involved in this transaction one, can comfortably project twice that number on transaction count. which is what matters in the market.

Its' unique offering is that they render the service without charging any fee unlike their competitors.

 The major technology is Fintech payment app which can be downloaded and installed on phone or laptop/PC to carry out transaction at the customers convinence.

## Landscape
The company operates in the payment processing domain

According to Ruben Salazor Global Head, Visa direct. "The largest and most important macro trend that is been experienced in the industry is real-time payments". inline with this the industry has been on  a marathon of introducing different solutions and innovation to meet up with the trend such as. Mobil app, Online Banking, POS Terminal, Web Payments, ATMs, Debit cards, credit cards, Electronic wallets.

Their competitors include Western Union Money Transfer International, RIA, PAYPAL, MONEYGRAM.

## Result
The business impact of Lamonade in the industry has been phenomenon, the company in its website claim to have over 100,000 customers as at date. This feat was achieved within 3years of operation.

Some of the major matrics used in measuring performance in this domain are number of customers and transaction count. Lamonade is not doing badly in these KPI's. For number of customers they have above 100,000 in just barely 3years of operations.

When measured against competition Lamonade is doing great, the avarage African imigrant on the street is now aware of the company and its product,from the way the companys popularity and acceptance is spreading they are most likely going to taking over the market.

## Recommendation
My  advice to the company is to start extending its services to the Northern and Southern part of Africa as they also has a huge immigrant population in the western world just as its competitors offer

By extending its services to these areas it will expand its transaction and operation base which if everything been equal will translate into more revenue and profoit.

In the course of this expansion there might be need to build more capacity as per bandwith, gateways and Internet access to accommodate more traffic as a result of increase number of customers.

These technologies are important to look into as the service to be rendered are web-based and are the back bone on which the solution will ride.
